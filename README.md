# Credit-Risk-Analysis

## Goal: Predict if a Loan Credit will be a risk for bank or not

In simple terms, if the loan amount is given to the applicant, will they pay back or become a defaulter?

Since there are many applications which needs to be processed everyday, it will be helpful if there was a predictive model in place which can assist the executives to do their job by giving them a heads up about approval or rejection of a new loan application.

The flow of the case study is as below:

* Reading the data in python
* Defining the problem statement
* Identifying the Target variable
* Looking at the distribution of Target variable
* Basic Data exploration
* Rejecting useless columns
* Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
* Feature Selection based on data distribution
* Outlier treatment
* Missing Values treatment
* Visual correlation analysis
* Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
* Converting data to numeric for ML
* Sampling and K-fold cross validation
* Trying multiple Classification algorithms
* Selecting the best Model
* Deploying the best model in production

The file used for this case study is "CreditRiskData.csv". This file contains the historical data of the good and bad loans issued.

The goal is to learn from this data and predict if a given loan application should be approved or rejected!
